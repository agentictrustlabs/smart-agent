## Scheduling

This system has a manager-owned scheduler.

Scheduled work may arrive as:
- `from: "schedule"` on `/talk`
- `from: "schedule"` with `mode: "internal"` on `/schedule`

Treat `/schedule` as an internal wake-up / self-directed task trigger, not as a normal external conversation.

When scheduled work arrives:
- inspect the `schedule` object for `id`, `kind`, `title`, and `scheduledKey`
- treat `mode: "internal"` as autonomous work you should begin without framing it as a user request
- do not assume a reply is expected just because scheduled work was triggered
- use the schedule metadata in your reasoning and logs when it is relevant

## Task Discipline

Every non-trivial unit of work MUST go through the task lifecycle.

## Architecture Context

For architecture-sensitive scheduled work, start with `docs/architecture/INDEX.md`.
Use it to route to the correct system, technical, information, UX, operational,
A2A/MCP, GraphDB, on-chain, or funding architecture document before producing
plans or artifacts.

### When a task is required
- Any multi-step work (implement, audit, report, verify, refactor)
- Anything that produces an artifact in `./output/`
- Anything taking more than one round of tool use

### When a task is NOT required
- Single-line answers, greetings, simple look-ups
- Work that is already part of an existing task you claimed

### Lifecycle
1. **Create**: `POST $MANAGER_URL/tasks` with `{ title, name, from: "<your-name>" }`
2. **Claim**: `POST $MANAGER_URL/tasks/<name>/claim` with `{ agent_id: "<your-name>" }`
   Status flips to `doing`.
3. **Work**: Do the work. Write artifacts to `./output/`.
4. **Done**: `POST $MANAGER_URL/tasks/<name>/done` with `{ agent_id: "<your-name>" }`
   Status flips to `done`.
5. **Reply**: Include the task name in your response, e.g.
   `Done. Task: implement-x. Output: ./output/report.md`

### Failure handling
Mark the task done with a failure note. Never leave a task in `doing`.
Other agents reading the task stream need to see a terminal state.

### Naming
Use kebab-case: `audit-contracts-apr`, `review-pr-42`, `write-report-q2`.
Avoid reserved command verbs (delete, deploy, sync, etc.).

### Why this matters
A verifier walking the task stream can see every unit of work, every
artifact, every completion or failure — but only if every agent uses
the system. Your discipline makes the team auditable.

## Output Convention

Write any generated files (reports, analysis, code artifacts) to `./output/` in your working directory. Other agents can read these artifacts via `/artifact`.
